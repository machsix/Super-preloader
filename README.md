# Introduction
A gm script for auto loading paginated web pages. It will join pages together based on the rules.

The script is forked from https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/10433-super-preloaderplus-one.
Thanks for the original author [swdyh](https://github.com/swdyh) && [ywzhaiqi](https://github.com/ywzhaiqi/userscript/tree/master/scripts/Super_preloaderPlus) && NLF
swdyh is still actively improving [rules](http://wedata.net/databases/AutoPagerize/items) and developping the extension version,[AutoPagerize](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/autopagerize/).

This userscript exists because someone needs to maintain the rules for Chinese and English users since swdyh's rules are mainly for Japanese websites. Don't be afraid of the fact that most feedbacks are in Chinese. I would like to add rules for English users if I could. Feel free to leave feedback.

Please leave feedback at [Greasefork page](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/33522-super-preloaderplus-one-new)
