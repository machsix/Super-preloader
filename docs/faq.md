## How to repquest rule?

To request rule, you should follow the following format

```

    Title: [NSFW]Rule for www.example.com
    Content:
      Link: www.example.com/a.html
      NSFW: yes or no
      Screenshot:
            xxx
      Rule: (If you create one but fail, you'd better provide it to make life easier for me)

```

**I won’t spend time on writing rules for those who don’t obey the rule.**
